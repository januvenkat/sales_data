# sales_data
The goal of the project is to analyze sales history data and identify key points
that made the business profitable or not. These key points should be clear
enough to help designing a new sales profitability strategy for the next year by
the marketing director of A-to-Z-Market.
The dataset for the analysis (sales.csv) contains the last 4-years sales data from
different regional stores in United States. It contains all details for each customer
order (dates, localization, products categories, shipping mode, quantity,
discounts, profitability, etc.).
You can use the profit ratio as a profitability indicator in your analysis. For a single
sale, the profit ratio is defined as the ratio between the amount of profit and the
amount of sale. However, when aggregating sales, the profit ratio should be the
ratio between the sum of profits and the sum of sales for each aggregated group.
